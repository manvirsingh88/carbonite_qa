# Carbonite_QA_Test
This project automates the sign up functionality.

I have developed a hybrid framework using TestNG for this project.

1: Test Cases for the application are present in the TestDescription Folder of the project.
2: Java Program for formatting date is present in the   com.qa.DateFormatter Package of the project. 
3: Extent Report API is used to generate customised reports.
4: Failed cases are re run for 3 times using Retry logic of TestNG.
